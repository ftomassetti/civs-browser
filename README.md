civs-browser
============

A web application to visualize the history files produced by [civs](https://github.com/ftomassetti/civs/)

The workflow is this one:
* use [lands](https://github.com/ftomassetti/lands) to generate your own realistic world, simulating the main physical phenomenons like plate tectonics, rain-shadow, erosion, etc.
* simulate the evolution of civilization, which spread, split, evolve, settle cities and create their one languages (see [langgen](https://github.com/ftomassetti/langgen/) if interested)
* use civs-browser (i.e. this project!) to explore the history you generate, looking at the facts which lead to the current situation, look into the reasons why a powerful empire collapsed, when a city was built and so on.

This project is really young, this is a work in progress. This is a first screenshot of the homepage as it looks now (pretty basic, eh?)
